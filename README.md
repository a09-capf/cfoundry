# new_cfoundry gem

This is fork from https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/cfoundry

cfoundry is a ruby gem that provides a REST client for the Cloud Foundry REST API, which is implemented by both the [cloud controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller) and the [next generation cloud controller](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cloud_controller_ng). cfoundry version 7+ can speak with the v2 version of the Cloud Foundry API.
